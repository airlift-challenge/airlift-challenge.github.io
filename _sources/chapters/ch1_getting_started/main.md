# Getting Started

Get started, see the [starter kit](https://github.com/airlift-challenge/airlift-starter-kit) README, which summarizes four key steps needed to prepare and submit a solution:
1) Setup prerequisites
2) Write your solution code
3) Test your solution
4) Submit

In building your solution, it may help to reference the following sections in the documentation:
* *[Model](sec_model)*. Formulates the model implemented by the simulator.
* *[Interface](sec_interface)*. Provides information regarding the observation and action spaces, as well as rewards and metrics.
* *Essential API*. Documents key classes and methods you may need to interact with.
* *[Solutions](sec_solutions)*. Provides some background on previous solutions to the airlift and related problems.
* *Simulator Code Documentation*. Although you do not need to understand the internals of the simulator to write a solution, it could help with debugging.
